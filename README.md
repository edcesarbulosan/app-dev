`Ferrari is known around the world as an iconic brand, synonymous with game-changing performance and unparalleled elegance. But before 1939, “Ferrari” meant “Enzo Ferrari,” the founder of the brand and head of the Scuderia Ferrari racing team for Alfa Romeo.`

term
: Ferrari comes from ferraro, meaning “blacksmith,” putting it on par with the English & American surname “Smith.”

I need to highlight these ==fierce passion, courage, and command of a domain that many would have thought unconquerable==.
